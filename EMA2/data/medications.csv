"abacavir;lamivudine;zidovudine";Trizivir;HIV Infections;"Trizivir is indicated for the treatment of human-immunodeficiency-virus (HIV) infection in adults. This fixed combination replaces the three components (abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine) used separately in similar dosages. It is recommended that treatment is started with abacavir, lamivudine,and zidovudine separately for the first six to eight weeks. The choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but mainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues. The demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease. In patients with high viral load (&gt;100,000 copies/ml) choice of therapy needs special consideration. Overall, the virologic suppression with this triple nucleoside regimen could be inferior to that obtained with other multitherapies notably including boosted protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, therefore the use of Trizivir should only be considered under special circumstances (e.g. co-infection with tuberculosis). Before initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be performed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin. Screening is also recommended prior to re-initiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir (see 'management after an interruption of Trizivir therapy'). Abacavir should not be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele, unless no other therapeutic option is available in these patients, based on the treatment history and resistance testing.";Authorised;https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/trizivir;Human

sulphur hexafluoride;SonoVue;"Ultrasonography;Echocardiography";This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. SonoVue is for use with ultrasound imaging to enhance the echogenicity of the blood, or of fluids in the urinary tract which results in an improved signal to noise ratio. SonoVue should only be used in patients where study without contrast enhancement is inconclusive. Echocardiography SonoVue is a transpulmonary echocardiographic contrast agent for use in adult patients with suspected or established cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac chambers and enhance left ventricular endocardial border delineation. Doppler of macrovasculature SonoVue increases the accuracy in detection or exclusion of abnormalities in cerebral arteries and extracranial carotid or peripheral arteries in adult patients by improving the Doppler signal to noise ratio. SonoVue increases the quality of the Doppler flow image and the duration of clinically useful signal enhancement in portal vein assessment in adult patients. Doppler of microvasculature SonoVue improves display of the vascularity of liver and breast lesions during Doppler sonography in adult patients leading to more specific lesion characterisation.

Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring significant resistance to any of the three components contained in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen. The demonstration of the benefit of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is primarily based on 48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic suppression on a combination antiretroviral therapy changed to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (see section 5.1). No data are currently available from clinical studies with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-naïve or in heavily pretreated patients.

Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is used on its own for this disease; • advanced ovarian cancer in women whose previous treatment including a platinum-based cancer medicine has stopped working; • multiple myeloma (a cancer of the white blood cells in the bone marrow), in patients with progressive disease who have received at least one other treatment in the past and have already had, or are unsuitable for, a bone marrow transplantation. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is used in combination with bortezomib (another cancer medicine); • Kaposi’s sarcoma in patients with AIDS who have a very damaged immune system. Kaposi’s sarcoma is a cancer that causes abnormal tissue to grow under the skin, on moist body surfaces or on internal organs. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal contains the active substance doxorubicin and is a ‘hybrid medicine’. This means that it is similar to a ‘reference medicine’ containing the same active substance called Adriamycin.

Chronic hepatitis C Before initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical trials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon. Adult patients IntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis-C virus-RNA (HCV-RNA). The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. Children three years of age and older and adolescents IntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children three years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case-by-case basis. Hairy-cell leukaemia Treatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia. Chronic myelogenous leukaemia Monotherapy Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia-chromosome- or bcr/abl-translocation-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

Combination therapy The combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months of treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses and to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b monotherapy. Multiple myeloma As maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50% reduction in myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy. Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs the plateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.
